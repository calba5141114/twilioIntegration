###  The program needs a secrets.json file in the root directory at the same level as the main.py file I took it out for publishing on github but the file should look like this:

    {
        "SID": "TWILIO_SID",
        "AUTH_TOKEN": "TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN",
        "TWILIO_NUMBER":"TWILIO_NUMBER"
    }
